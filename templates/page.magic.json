When I started to dig deeper, I found that while feminine care was beginning to receive the “clean beauty treatment”, many of the bestselling products on the market were still using Vagina and Vulva interchangeably or vaguely referencing “care down there”. Not to mention they were using known skin irritants under the guise of “natural”. As a physician, I knew the importance of correctly identifying, labeling, and caring for our most intimate, unique, and empowering zones and the harm that could be done in not doing so. I knew I could do better for women and set out to conquer the next frontier of skincare - VULVA CARE!</p><p>[signature]</p>",
